8,"'Entitled' is a fairly meaningless word that does not accurately describe most of the incels on this sub or elsewhere on the Internet. On one extreme, the word 'entitled' is used to describe men how literally believe that they should be able to force women to date them. On the other extreme, the word 'entitled' is used to describe men who are merely frustrated or sad that they can't find anyone at all to date them.

1. Research suggests plants may react to stimuli, that's not the same thing as feeling pain. They have no central nervous system and no brain. There are no studies that suggest they feel pain. However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves. 

2. I'd see no ethical issue eating lab meat. I might abstain for other reasons though (after a few years as a vegan, I don't really have any interest in eating meat anymore).

> What is it about pain that makes a life special? Can I eat a person with a genetic trait that makes them immune to pain?

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living. 

> It seems pretty arrogant that some people want to tell everyone which lives matter and which don't.

Surely you don't think all lives are of equal moral value, or else killing a potato would be no different from killing a human. If you make that distinction (as I hope you would), why is it such a leap to morally distinguish between potato and cow?

Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves. 

2. I'd see no ethical issue eating lab meat. I might abstain for other reasons though (after a few years as a vegan, I don't really have any interest in eating meat anymore).

> What is it about pain that makes a life special? Can I eat a person with a genetic trait that makes them immune to pain?

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living. 

> It seems pretty arrogant that some people want to tell everyone which lives matter and which don't.

Surely you don't think all lives are of equal moral value, or else killing a potato would be no different from killing a human.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves.

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living.

However, even if you want to claim plants ""feel,"" it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel *equally* to a chicken, cow, or pig. If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one, presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more. Additionally, even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration, it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too - and they eat plants, lots of them. Cut out the middle man, and you kill fewer animals and plants. I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that. There is an [interesting debate](https://sentientist.org/2013/05/20/the-ethical-case-for-eating-oysters-and-mussels/) on the ethics of eating bivalves. 

2. I'd see no ethical issue eating lab meat. I might abstain for other reasons though (after a few years as a vegan, I don't really have any interest in eating meat anymore).

> What is it about pain that makes a life special? Can I eat a person with a genetic trait that makes them immune to pain?

It's not just about physical pain, though that's an important part of it. Even if I don't feel pain, I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living. 

> It seems pretty arrogant that some people want to tell everyone which lives matter and which don't.

Surely you don't think all lives are of equal moral value, or else killing a potato would be no different from killing a human. If you make that distinction (as I hope you would), why is it such a leap to morally distinguish between potato and cow? It's not arrogance, it's a rational argument for equal consideration of interests.",. ,-0.014698856472159605,↓ decrease toxic

71,"1. There is no dynamic lighting. All dynamic shadows in the game are made via the HL2 method, where they only appear directly under the object casting the shadow. They aren't able to utilize helpful effects like parallax mapping, soft particles, real-time ambient occlusion, global illumination, and real-time reflections (except for the water).

2. texture resolution was unbelievably low as well as object polycount. Imagine those beautiful hand painted textures at full res instead of all pixelated when you get closer than 5 feet.

3. Level size and occlusion. In Unreal 3 you have to design levels in chunks. I'd wager that in the Void engine (Dishonored 2's engine) the Distillery District, Slackjaw's Distillery, The Office of the High Overseer, and The Golden Cat levels could all be stitched together with no loading times. I mean even SOMA's HPL Engine 3 allows for level streaming. The only loading screen is when you start the game.

What they managed to achieve using Unreal 3 for Dishonored was incredible, but it was clearly designed (gameplay and visual effects wise) around their limitations. I'm very excited to see the world of Dishonored rendered with modern technology. ",ax ,0.013001686148076189,↑ increase toxic

98,">Book theories or predictions should not use show happenings as evidence in support or against that theory.

Look, I'm all in favor of the co-existence and necessity of both subs, more and more as the years pass and the show surprasses the books, so I'm sorry if I sound harsh, but I've been bothered by this for some time.. 

That rule right there is what turns me off, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. There's a place and context for everything, and show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory on your sub, I agree on that. But, with all due respect, burying the head in the sand and ignoring everything that ever happened on the show is just... pointless denial, to say the least. As I've said, show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory there, but they sure as well should be allowed to, in some sort of way, strenght them, even in minimally. Used as some sort of evidence or final argument.

For example, and in all honestly, when discussing and theorizing anything about Melisandre, there's no point in ignoring [Spoilers S6E1](/s ""the reveal in S6E1 that Melissandre is a glamoured old woman""). 

How about Hodor's name origin, something that was confirmed by Martin, despite being show happening? Do you ignore? Pretend it never happened? [Spoilers S5E9](/s ""Shireen's burning, which D&D confirmed is something that will happen to some sort in the book?"")

What about (f)Aegon? Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books, ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show, obviously his part is not that important? Jeyne's possible pregnancy? 

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

And let's not even mention R+L=J. In that sub are we still supposed to consider that as a 99% certain theory? Theories about Ashara Dayne's being Jon's mother are still accepted?

I mean, for a proper discussion and theory, every piece of avaliable information should be used. Try to minimize the show-references, sure, go ahead, but outright remove them is, as I've said, burying the head in the sand.

Reminds me of when this sub decided to outright ban any discussion on the leaked episodes in season 5. Everybody saw them, everybody knew what happened, and yet people were discussing S5E1 in the daily thread like everything was normal and episode 2 might even bring us Lady Stoneheart.

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

That rule right there is what turns me off, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. There's a place and context for everything, and show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory on your sub, I agree on that. But, with all due respect, burying the head in the sand and ignoring everything that ever happened on the show is just... pointless denial, to say the least. As I've said, show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory there, but they sure as well should be allowed to, in some sort of way, strenght them, even in minimally. Used as some sort of evidence or final argument.

For example, and in all honestly, when discussing and theorizing anything about Melisandre, there's no point in ignoring [Spoilers S6E1](/s ""the reveal in S6E1 that Melissandre is a glamoured old woman""). 

How about Hodor's name origin, something that was confirmed by Martin, despite being show happening? Do you ignore? Pretend it never happened? [Spoilers S5E9](/s ""Shireen's burning, which D&D confirmed is something that will happen to some sort in the book?"")

What about (f)Aegon? Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books, ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show, obviously his part is not that important? Jeyne's possible pregnancy? 

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

And let's not even mention R+L=J. In that sub are we still supposed to consider that as a 99% certain theory? Theories about Ashara Dayne's being Jon's mother are still accepted?

I mean, for a proper discussion and theory, every piece of avaliable information should be used. Try to minimize the show-references, sure, go ahead, but outright remove them is, as I've said, burying the head in the sand.

Look, I'm all in favor of the co-existence and necessity of both subs, more and more as the years pass and the show surprasses the books, so I'm sorry if I sound harsh, but I've been bothered by this for some time.. 

That rule right there is what turns me off, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. There's a place and context for everything, and show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory on your sub, I agree on that. But, with all due respect, burying the head in the sand and ignoring everything that ever happened on the show is just... pointless denial, to say the least. As I've said, show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory there, but they sure as well should be allowed to, in some sort of way, strenght them, even in minimally. Used as some sort of evidence or final argument.

For example, and in all honestly, when discussing and theorizing anything about Melisandre, there's no point in ignoring [Spoilers S6E1](/s ""the reveal in S6E1 that Melissandre is a glamoured old woman""). 

How about Hodor's name origin, something that was confirmed by Martin, despite being show happening? Do you ignore? Pretend it never happened? [Spoilers S5E9](/s ""Shireen's burning, which D&D confirmed is something that will happen to some sort in the book?"")

What about (f)Aegon? Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books, ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show, obviously his part is not that important? Jeyne's possible pregnancy? 

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

And let's not even mention R+L=J. In that sub are we still supposed to consider that as a 99% certain theory? Theories about Ashara Dayne's being Jon's mother are still accepted?

I mean, for a proper discussion and theory, every piece of avaliable information should be used. Try to minimize the show-references, sure, go ahead, but outright remove them is, as I've said, burying the head in the sand.

That rule right there is what turns me off, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. There's a place and context for everything, and show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory on your sub, I agree on that. But, with all due respect, burying the head in the sand and ignoring everything that ever happened on the show is just... pointless denial, to say the least. As I've said, show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory there, but they sure as well should be allowed to, in some sort of way, strenght them, even in minimally. Used as some sort of evidence or final argument.

For example, and in all honestly, when discussing and theorizing anything about Melisandre, there's no point in ignoring [Spoilers S6E1](/s ""the reveal in S6E1 that Melissandre is a glamoured old woman""). 

How about Hodor's name origin, something that was confirmed by Martin, despite being show happening? Do you ignore? Pretend it never happened? [Spoilers S5E9](/s ""Shireen's burning, which D&D confirmed is something that will happen to some sort in the book?"")

What about (f)Aegon? Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books, ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show, obviously his part is not that important? Jeyne's possible pregnancy? 

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

And let's not even mention R+L=J. In that sub are we still supposed to consider that as a 99% certain theory? Theories about Ashara Dayne's being Jon's mother are still accepted?

I mean, for a proper discussion and theory, every piece of avaliable information should be used. Try to minimize the show-references, sure, go ahead, but outright remove them is, as I've said, burying the head in the sand.

What about (f)Aegon? Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books, ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show, obviously his part is not that important? Jeyne's possible pregnancy? 

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

For example, and in all honestly, when discussing and theorizing anything about Melisandre, there's no point in ignoring [Spoilers S6E1](/s ""the reveal in S6E1 that Melissandre is a glamoured old woman"").

What about (f)Aegon? Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books, ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show, obviously his part is not that important? Jeyne's possible pregnancy? 

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

And let's not even mention R+L=J. In that sub are we still supposed to consider that as a 99% certain theory? Theories about Ashara Dayne's being Jon's mother are still accepted?

What about (f)Aegon? Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books, ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show, obviously his part is not that important? Jeyne's possible pregnancy? 

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

And let's not even mention R+L=J. In that sub are we still supposed to consider that as a 99% certain theory? Theories about Ashara Dayne's being Jon's mother are still accepted?

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

What about (f)Aegon? Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books, ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show, obviously his part is not that important? Jeyne's possible pregnancy? 

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

For example, and in all honestly, when discussing and theorizing anything about Melisandre, there's no point in ignoring [Spoilers S6E1](/s ""the reveal in S6E1 that Melissandre is a glamoured old woman"").

What about (f)Aegon? Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books, ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show, obviously his part is not that important? Jeyne's possible pregnancy? 

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

And let's not even mention R+L=J. In that sub are we still supposed to consider that as a 99% certain theory? Theories about Ashara Dayne's being Jon's mother are still accepted?

Look, I'm all in favor of the co-existence and necessity of both subs, more and more as the years pass and the show surprasses the books, so I'm sorry if I sound harsh, but I've been bothered by this for some time.. 

That rule right there is what turns me off, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. There's a place and context for everything, and show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory on your sub, I agree on that. But, with all due respect, burying the head in the sand and ignoring everything that ever happened on the show is just... pointless denial, to say the least. As I've said, show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory there, but they sure as well should be allowed to, in some sort of way, strenght them, even in minimally. Used as some sort of evidence or final argument.

For example, and in all honestly, when discussing and theorizing anything about Melisandre, there's no point in ignoring [Spoilers S6E1](/s ""the reveal in S6E1 that Melissandre is a glamoured old woman""). 

How about Hodor's name origin, something that was confirmed by Martin, despite being show happening? Do you ignore? Pretend it never happened? [Spoilers S5E9](/s ""Shireen's burning, which D&D confirmed is something that will happen to some sort in the book?"")

What about (f)Aegon? Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books, ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show, obviously his part is not that important? Jeyne's possible pregnancy? 

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

And let's not even mention R+L=J. In that sub are we still supposed to consider that as a 99% certain theory? Theories about Ashara Dayne's being Jon's mother are still accepted?

I mean, for a proper discussion and theory, every piece of avaliable information should be used. Try to minimize the show-references, sure, go ahead, but outright remove them is, as I've said, burying the head in the sand.

Reminds me of when this sub decided to outright ban any discussion on the leaked episodes in season 5. Everybody saw them, everybody knew what happened, and yet people were discussing S5E1 in the daily thread like everything was normal and episode 2 might even bring us Lady Stoneheart.

For example, and in all honestly, when discussing and theorizing anything about Melisandre, there's no point in ignoring [Spoilers S6E1](/s ""the reveal in S6E1 that Melissandre is a glamoured old woman""). 

How about Hodor's name origin, something that was confirmed by Martin, despite being show happening? Do you ignore? Pretend it never happened? [Spoilers S5E9](/s ""Shireen's burning, which D&D confirmed is something that will happen to some sort in the book?"")

What about (f)Aegon? Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books, ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show, obviously his part is not that important? Jeyne's possible pregnancy? 

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

And let's not even mention R+L=J. In that sub are we still supposed to consider that as a 99% certain theory? Theories about Ashara Dayne's being Jon's mother are still accepted?

Look, I'm all in favor of the co-existence and necessity of both subs, more and more as the years pass and the show surprasses the books, so I'm sorry if I sound harsh, but I've been bothered by this for some time.. 

That rule right there is what turns me off, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. There's a place and context for everything, and show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory on your sub, I agree on that. But, with all due respect, burying the head in the sand and ignoring everything that ever happened on the show is just... pointless denial, to say the least. As I've said, show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory there, but they sure as well should be allowed to, in some sort of way, strenght them, even in minimally. Used as some sort of evidence or final argument.

For example, and in all honestly, when discussing and theorizing anything about Melisandre, there's no point in ignoring [Spoilers S6E1](/s ""the reveal in S6E1 that Melissandre is a glamoured old woman""). 

How about Hodor's name origin, something that was confirmed by Martin, despite being show happening? Do you ignore? Pretend it never happened? [Spoilers S5E9](/s ""Shireen's burning, which D&D confirmed is something that will happen to some sort in the book?"")

What about (f)Aegon? Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books, ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show, obviously his part is not that important? Jeyne's possible pregnancy? 

[Spoilers Season 6](/s ""Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities""). Are we supposed to ignore all that?

And let's not even mention R+L=J. In that sub are we still supposed to consider that as a 99% certain theory? Theories about Ashara Dayne's being Jon's mother are still accepted?

I mean, for a proper discussion and theory, every piece of avaliable information should be used. Try to minimize the show-references, sure, go ahead, but outright remove them is, as I've said, burying the head in the sand.

Reminds me of when this sub decided to outright ban any discussion on the leaked episodes in season 5. Everybody saw them, everybody knew what happened, and yet people were discussing S5E1 in the daily thread like everything was normal and episode 2 might even bring us Lady Stoneheart.
