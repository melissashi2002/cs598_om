5,5,You and your friends are pretty lame. ,Showerthoughts,True,"I dunno... I'm in my mid 30s and my friends and I talk about it like crazy. Mostly because we don't drink that often anymore so when we do, we black out and then talk about how we all blacked out and we're so hungover the following day. 

That's the joy of being married and/or having kids I guess. "
145,145,"I'd take a gurl out to a $60 dinner, and if I get laid, that's kool.

I'll skip on a $60 hooker!",Showerthoughts,True,"Well I'm refering to a established relationship. You theoretically don't pay for having sex with your loved one.  But if you don't have a relationship that it's real enough to have sex with, you have to pay to have sex with someone."
280,280,Why was your dad so lazy?,Showerthoughts,True,When I was a kid my father use to say we were to poor to afford ghosts only rich people had them. Perhaps you are to horny to have ghosts only bored virgins have them. 0_o
441,441,"Not everyone can afford to pay a literal arm and a leg to check something out at the doctor's office that may or may not actually be important or life threatening. 

Ain't nobody got time or money for that, unless you like to pay hundreds of dolars to be told ""everything is fine mmkay"".",Showerthoughts,False,"Look at this guy over here, with money for the doctor! Jeez, go back to your yacht!"
634,634,Doubt that's true. [Source - I've seen a cop in Manhattam give a ticket to brown paper bag beer drinkers. ],Showerthoughts,False,"Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but it was a loophole to drink in public.  Since a cop doesn't technically see an alcohol container that can be confirmed, he can't hastle you, and he can't search you for no reason.  I'm not sure if that's still the case anywhere, but I believe it was at one point"
780,780,"Leg pain at night? Maybe it's sciatica. I've dealt with it. Sciatica is a symptom, not a diagnosis. It could be the result of tight glutes, or compressed discs (or, god forbid, herniated discs) in the spine. If it only bothers you at night, I'm inclined to think it's the former, in which case you can fix it with some yoga pigeon stretches, and maybe pick up a foam roller to massage the flutes and hip flexors (look it up on youtube it's too hard to describe here). If it's the latter, that's trickier. Sometimes it can be fixed with physical therapy, but sometimes it needs surgery. ",Showerthoughts,True,"Same, except It's dreading work the next day and leg pain that keeps me from sleeping."
894,894,"Still, it's too long. I'd be impressed if they were like ""Yo I can retire in 2 years"". That would be awesome",Showerthoughts,False,"No one brags about having a savings rate that will allow them to retire in 40 years. 

There are also a lot of really young people with careers right out of college. When you are making good money and your mom it's for your cellphone and you drive the car from high school it's easier to save. Some of those people will stick with saving a big percent and many will have life catch up with them. "
941,941,And roll around that hula hoop thing with a stick.,Showerthoughts,False,"What everyone is forgetting is that Monopoly was invented in 1904, which was before fun was invented (In the late 50's), so back then the only alternative to Monopoly was to throw rocks at each other.

Still, give them a bit and I'm sure they'll have more available as the tech progresses. Even what they show is straight sifi-level awesome."

1801,1801,Boogers definitely smell worse than ear wax when you've got sinusitis,Showerthoughts,False,"&gt; Sinusitis is inflammation of the sinuses resulting in symptoms. Common signs and symptoms include thick nasal mucus, a plugged nose, and pain in the face.

So are you saying one can't smell anything, including ear wax, or that your boogers stink when having sinusitis?"
1810,1810,Please feel free to cut yourself on the edge. Preferably your wrists in a vertical line. ,Showerthoughts,True,"Don't cut yourself on that edge, lad."
2551,2551,"I worked retail and I still don't, I'm just fuckin lazy ",Showerthoughts,False,No kidding. People would actually put the clothes back on the hanger and not throw it over the rack. It literally takes 2 seconds to put something back that you messed up.

2822,2822,"Can confirm. My mom is a CA in public accounting and works 7-6 everyday, comes home to dinner cooked by my newly-retired father, and then often works from 7-9. That's a typical week. When it's month-end, quarter-end or year-end, it's that schedule on steroids. Don't think I could ever do that kind of work, though the money sounds appealing, you're practically a slave.",Showerthoughts,False,"&gt;if you manage your time right and don't let bosses bully you, there's no need for an all nighter in the real world. you get paid for the work you do. Once your home, theres no homework. 

For the industry that u/nukdabomb is going into, all nighters are common, and work does follow you home. If you just do a 9-5 workday you won't last very long in accounting/finance, esp if you want to work at the big 4 cpa firms. "
2985,2985,"And they taper to what *was* the max allowable base size. That went up and you can get wider condoms in ""normal"" brands.",Showerthoughts,False,Those actually taper so they end up being functionally pretty much the same size as normal ones. Its really just for the name.
3023,3023,McDonald's is always hiring.,Showerthoughts,True,"I deliver appliances for a large company, and this time a year I've put 65-75 hours a week. 

I would kill for a job that paid me less and gives me 8-9 shifts."
3086,3086,The Daily Show is an embarrassment to both comedy and news.,Showerthoughts,False,"Do you think it's because with the 24/7 news cycle after the iraq wars, it's now ""entertainment?""

3682,3682,"Um. The human genome contains about three billion base pairs. These can be encoded in two bits, giving a total information content on the order of 750 megabytes. Considering that any two humans share over 99 % of their DNA one could further argue that the actual information transmitted by intercourse is on the order of 7.5 megabytes, which leads me to conclude that you're equipped with a fiber optic member or conveyed your story through port number two.",Showerthoughts,True, I've transferred about 600 GB to OP's mom in a mere 10 seconds.

edit: just because I'm a nerd with nothing better to do, 10 minutes would be 1/2016 of a fortnight."
4114,4114,Ohhh interesting! I didn't know that lol,Showerthoughts,False,"No, it's considered an unfair advantage. You have to do your own, or be prepared to prove that your makeup/hair artist was not a pro (licensed or had worked as a makeup/hair artist).

So like, your sister who's good at makeup can help you, but not if she has so much as worked at Sephora or been to cosmetology school for a day."
4216,4216,"Maybe if you were running intel celeron graphics?

P.S. Happy cake day!",Showerthoughts,False,"It took my mom a solid year to realize that my two monitors ran on the same computer. She used to think I just had two PCs running next to each other for some reason, despite only having one keyboard and mouse?

I don't even know how that would be helpful or productive."
4236,4236,You finally find the perfect research video after 29 minutes of searching. You click the play button. Boom chrome exits. You rage so much you decide to kill yourself ,Showerthoughts,True,"&gt; With incognito you just have to remember to click the X button 

that's a pretty daunting task...they should make a session that automatically closes after a certain amount of time."
4289,4289,"I'm just building off of what OP said.

It's pretty stupid, really. You don't get invited. Then you work yourself up. Then you ask to join the party that you weren't previously invited to and you get the green light. But as OP (OC?) said, once you have that invite you all of a sudden don't want to go because you just cared about the fact that you were being thought of. But then you feel obliged to go.

And it's not like I sit there sulking the entire time or anything. Sometimes I just genuinely don't find the activities we do fun, nevermind the fact that you have to be there the whole time knowing you were initially left out, and at the end of the night you just kinda say ""Well, truthfully, I'd be happier if I just stayed home.""

So I spent my night learning I wasn't invited, securing my own invitation, and, in the end, not having fun. But you'll sure as hell do it again next time because maybe it beats being home alone.

It's really stupid and sort of a paradox, but that's just how I feel about it. I'm not trying to be an attention whore, I'm just expressing my feelings on the subject brought about by the post.",Showerthoughts,True,"Then why complain/worry about being invited or not? If you don't want to go, just don't."

5458,5458,"I don't disagree.  Most people are smart, but either very ambitious or very lazy, and they use their intelligence solely to further their own agendas.  Occasionally a less than bright employee makes it through and hangs around long enough to be difficult to fire (even in a right to work state.)  So you have bright ambitious people, cleverly lazy people, and dim bulbs all gumming up the administration from top to bottom, often at competing ends.

5795,5795,"So why not move there?

I'm not being a dick, by the way. Not my intent (YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR COUNTRY THEN GET OUT) 

I'm just genuinely curious as to why you don't move to a country that practices something as close to what you feel is the right way to go. 

Also, doesn't Cuba rely on other countries that aren't communist in order to function? ",Showerthoughts,False,"Cuba is the closest to what I'd call communist. It's actually a great example of where a communist revolution has broken the chains of poverty for millions.

Ussr and china both ""worked"" until revisionists rose to power and started enacting capitalist reforms."
