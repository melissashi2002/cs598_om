776,776,"&gt;1 hour of work does not an employed person make.

This honestly doesn't make much difference, and Roy Morgan count someone working 1 hour a week as employed too.

The number of people working 1 hour in a given period isn't that big, and it also includes a lot of people who usually work more. Checking the most recent figures, about 700k reported working 1-9 hours in whatever week we're talking about, which is about the same as the number of people who have a job but worked *zero* hours due to leave or whatever.

Critically, all these people reporting that they have jobs but worked 0 hours or 1-9 hours would show up as employed in Roy Morgan's survey, too, since they, you know, *have jobs*.

The biggest differences between Roy Morgan and the international standard definition of unemployment used by ABS are twofold.

The first is the definition of what ""looking for work"" means. It is tighter in the UN/International Labour Organisation definition (which is used by the ABS like any equivalent national body, and has nothing to do with what the government wants since the ABS is an independent agency). Specifically, you have to be actively looking for work, and ready to start work immediately, in order to be counted as unemployed within the labour force.

Roy Morgan also uses the ""looking for work"" definition, but there's is a much simpler self-reported question and therefore they don't factor in whether someone is available to work or not. For example, someone who is at school or uni, and in practical terms couldn't start work, but said they were looking, would be counted as unemployed. The difference between asking ""do you want a job?"" and actually asking about job-seeking activities and availability is the main source of difference in levels.

The second reason for variation is the ABS makes seasonal and trend adjustments so that the movement in u/e rate from period to period is reflecting actual change in the strength of the economy. Seasonal adjustment accounts for the fact that less people work in certain months (for example the Christmas boom, and agricultural harvest season). You can see the regular [jaggedness in this graph](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XmbV2lJXNHA/UDgcpNF7DHI/AAAAAAAACYg/BfZopElTbfI/s1600/DEEWR-payments-Original-Count-Unemployed-line-from1950.png) where unemployment declines around November and goes back up around February.

If we're being cynical, not accounting for seasonality gives Roy Morgan reliable headlines every few months as their estimates diverge more sharply from the ABS.

The reason for the focus on immediate availability and accounting for seasonality is there's a strong policy interest (particularly for the Reserve Bank in setting monetary policy) in knowing very specifically what working capacity in the economy is like, and a great measure of that is how many people are immediately available to work at a given moment. The RBA want to know if a movement in the unemployment rate is due to mere seasonality or due to the economy speeding up or slowing down.

In either case, to get the full picture of people's labour activities including underemployment, you need other data, things like who would like more hours, the hours worked per worker, who is studying, who is injured or disabled, structural vs frictional reasons for unemployment, etc. Unemployment rate alone was never intended to be a measure of social wellbeing - there's plenty of circumstances where an increase in the unemployment rate is strictly a good thing (eg if it's caused by more people seeking work, that can reflect an uptick in confidence).",australia,False,"It's not meaningful in any context. 1 hour of work does not an employed person make.

",australia,False,"It doesn't seem like you do, and given that I have never stated any 'fuck the rich rhetoric' it looks like you're falling for something that you've created yourself.

Actually, no.

Here's what I support. Realistic historical analysis.

Many economic theories have *some* point to them, but overall models tend to fail as they attempt to squash reality into their framework which is inherently doomed.

Going back to Locke and applying that to Keynesian economics, you can (if you want) argue that Locke's points about rent being 'dead' money related to Kenynesian theories of excess savings being detrimental to the economy, as one example.

To a certain extent, that's kind of true. But when you look at 'net' savings of an entire nation, it kind of doesn't quite work that way. When the ultra-rich hoard, that becomes a problem. However, when the middle to lower income brackets have what most Keynesians would define as excess savings, that actually becomes a beneficial aspect to the economy as they do not default on loans, fall behind on bills, or suffer the vagaries of existence that come from not having enough money.

The Laffer curve likewise is pure fantastical bullshit, and does not actually relate to real world historical examples, and is as I mentioned elsewhere, an example of a bullshit economic theory used to push certain agendas.

So, one way of determining whether someone actually understands how economics in the real world works, is to ask them something like your question.

If they respond with either, they don't get it.

If they can point out the pros and cons of both, while discussing how the theories themselves are fundamentally flawed, they may well actually understand economics as opposed to understanding economic theory, which does not actually relate, more often than not, to real world cases other than by brute force measures.

Also, yes, there's an obvious tie-in with the two and Locke. "

6090,6090,"It is important to note here that while offsetting losses against other income is fair and common, there isn't another country in the world that lets you offset investment losses against wage or salary income. Australia is unique in that respect, and along with the CGT discount that's where the distortion comes from. In most other countries, you can only offset losses in a prticular income stream against income from the same stream, i.e. property losses against income from property - not across income streams.",australia,False,"Here is my ELI10. It simplifies the tax system and ignores CGT. whatevs. I fudged my maths slightly somewhere, but the point remains:

Basically, you buy a rental property with a loan and you claim the interest payments (and other expenses) as a deduction against your *income*, rather than having the interest expense quarantined to being deducted against the rent.

Hypothetical land, where numbers are made up

Say you earn $200,000 and pay 50% tax (you pay $100,000 tax per year) . You get a loan to buy a rental property for $700,000. You pay 5% interest on this loan ($35,000) and earn $10,000 in rent. You make a $25,000 loss on your rental property and get to declare this as a deduction against your income every year. 

This means that every year you're losing $25,000 on your rental property, but gaining $12,500 of that in tax savings. Total net loss of $12,500/year.

So why the fuck would you deliberately buy a property thatâ€™s losing you $12,500 per year???

Fast forward 5 years. You've lost $62,500 due to that pesky rental property.

But that rental property you bought for 700,000 is now worth $1,000,000. Time to sell! You make $300,000 in sweet sweet profit, less the $62,000 in rental losses. $237,000 for sitting on a property for a few years. Not too shabby. You never really planned to make any rental profit off that property. You only bought it for the tax deduction and for the profit on sale.

Because it works by giving you a deduction on your income, it's great for the person on $200,000 who is paying 50% tax. It aint so great for someone on $50,000 who pays say 20% tax. The $25,000 tax deduction per year should only save them say $5,000 per year, meaning a net loss of $20,000/yr. over 5 years they lose $100,000 in rent, meaning they only net $200,000 from the sale. Not bad, but it doesn't benefit them nearly as much

**Why bad?**

1) Loss of tax revenue! The stuff that builds roads, hospitals, schools, NBNs. these people are claiming a tax deduction on their ""rental property"" when really they're buying the property with the *intention* of making a loss. We let that fucking rich guy claim $62,500 in deductions. That could've paid for a nurse for a year.

Generally a smarter way would be to quarantine their rental property as being its own ""entity"" for tax purposes. What does your rental property have to do with your job as a lawyer? Nothing. So why do you get to declare it as a loss against your lawyer income?

2) It makes it too damn appealing to buy a rental property because the ""loophole"" is just too good. It's basically free money. Lots of people buying houses that they don't need (or wouldn't want if it wasn't for the sweet sweet tax deduction), drives up prices due to supply and demand. There's a fixed supply of houses but demand keeps rising as people want to buy tax deduction houses. 

3) it also means that there are a lot of people with mortgages on overpriced houses that they're not even making a profit on. Eventually the housing bubble will burst and we'll have loans worth more than the house is worth. 

The housing bubble pops and we have the lady on $50,000 income with a rental property that's costing her $20,000 per year and is now only worth $500,000. 

In my lawyer example, *without negative gearing* he would have lost $25,00/yr for 5 years (total loss 125,000) before selling for $300,000. He still gains 175,000, but that's far less than the $237,000 he got with the benefit of negative gearing. That extra cash comes from our tax dollars. We're paying for his investment property"
