",aww,False,"Yeah I've met way too many people who buy big energetic dog breeds and then stick them in a crate at home 10 hours a day and think a couple 10 minute walks and a bimonthly trip to the dog park is enough to keep them entertained and exercised. There's a reason that so many big dogs are on leashes designed to help their owners control them, it's because so many of them don't put in the effort to train and enrich their dogs. I get downvoted for saying it but I've seen way too many labs and pitbulls so desperate for human interaction that they can't help jumping on people. I've seen them knock over kids and old people alike and then the owner does that nervous laugh apology thing as if dogs are just the craziest thing!!

And then Reddit is filled with a bunch of desperate comments like ""small dogs are mean!!!"" because of confirmation bias and to distract anyone from making comments about poorly behaved large dogs. "

He'd bring the dog to work every day, was always the one taking the dog for his first walk in the morning, the two were inseparable. They were normally really happy, but when the dad would go away on business the dog would get deeply depressed. He'd still be sociable, come say hi and let you pet him, but everything was done at half speed with his tail between his legs in a distracted sort of way. You could tell he was super bummed, and just going through the motions till the dad came home. Witnessing a creature with that level of devotion was actually really adorable, albeit totally heartbreaking..."
