All the same I have a question for you. I don't need your answer, you can share it if you want, but it's not that kind of question. Here it is: When was the last time you looked at your opinions and beliefs, what you hold to be true, and really considered if you might be wrong on a few things? When's the last time you challenged your preconceptions or your views of the world? It's something everyone should do, but almost no one does. So don't feel bad if your answer is ""rarely or never."" I know I don't as often as I should. But maybe you do, in which case that's good to hear.

Hey, buddy, that term might hurt [press secretary Sean Spicer's feelings](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/21/politics/sean-spicer-fact-check/).

If it's a membrane that can tear and bleed, it would explain the stories I've heard about friends tearing theirs and bleeding riding their bike or falling down the stairs. All of this ""it's not supposed to bleed if you do it right"" even seems a little silly, I've heard of people going as slow and gentle as possible the first time inserting things and still experience that sharp pain and bleeding. It's not like I'm trying to say that it's a covering membrane that only breaks when you lose your virginity and has to break when you lose your virginity, but just because that's not the truth doesn't mean we need to completely over exaggerate the other way. If it can easily bleed through unrelated physical activity, telling people ""it's not ""supposed"" to tear or bleed"" is just spreading misinformation to people about how their body works, and just much a lie as the whole popping the cherry notion."

The dog likely knows that bad things happen when he eats the food in front of the human, but that doesn't necessarily translate into the dog having an understanding that he is misbehaving or that he is consciously weighing his options here (that he thinks the food is worth misbehaving for).

For example, if you burn your tongue when eating hot pizza, you probably aren't going to stop eating pizza altogether, you're just going to be more careful about when you eat it. The same idea can apply for dogs. Let's say you scold the dog for eating food left out, dog then learns it's bad to eat food when you're there, but nothing bad happens when you're not."
