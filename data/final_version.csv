7,'Entitled' is a fairly meaningless word that does not accurately describe most of the incels on this sub or elsewhere on the Internet On one extreme the word 'entitled' is used to describe men how literally believe that they should be able to force women to date them On the other extreme the word 'entitled' is used to describe men who are merely frustrated or sad that they can't find anyone at all to date them This type of frustration is reasonable since sex and romantic relationships are regarded by many as one of the most fulfilling things in life The problem with using the word 'entitled' for both categories of men is that it lumps them together demonizing men in the latter category by comparing them to men in the former category If you wish to criticize our views please be more specific than merely calling us 'entitled ' I am a bot and this action was performed automatically Please contact the moderators of this subreddit message compose to r Incels if you have any questions or concerns

75,There is no evidence The only thing we know is he ended up starting a war and betraying his family and abandoning his wife to either go fuck an engaged woman or for a prophecy He cost thousands their lives who had nothing to do with his obsession and may have even kidnapped and raped lyanna to do it Its convenient how you Rhaegar apologists always conveniently forget about his wife and children he betrayed and all the innocents he got caught up in his bullshit
78,Based on his eye patch and what looks like poor ocular alignment I would say he definitely has diplopia
79,Not the person you asked but I can give you my answers here 1 Research suggests plants may react to stimuli that's not the same thing as feeling pain They have no central nervous system and no brain There are no studies that suggest they feel pain However even if you want to claim plants feel it would be a huge and unsubstantiated leap to claim they feel equally to a chicken cow or pig If I set before you a carrot and a dog and told you that you had to kill one presumably you'd kill the carrot over the dog because the dog would suffer far more Additionally even if you wanted to give plants moral consideration it should be noted that you kill fewer plants on a veg diet than an omnivorous one because livestock have to eat too and they eat plants lots of them Cut out the middle man and you kill fewer animals and plants I don't know much about the sentience of insects and such so I won't really comment on that There is an interesting debate https sentientist org 2013 05 20 the ethical case for eating oysters and mussels on the ethics of eating bivalves 2 I'd see no ethical issue eating lab meat I might abstain for other reasons though after a few years as a vegan I don't really have any interest in eating meat anymore What is it about pain that makes a life special Can I eat a person with a genetic trait that makes them immune to pain It's not just about physical pain though that's an important part of it Even if I don't feel pain I don't want you to kill me because I have an interest in living It seems pretty arrogant that some people want to tell everyone which lives matter and which don't Surely you don't think all lives are of equal moral value or else killing a potato would be no different from killing a human If you make that distinction as I hope you would why is it such a leap to morally distinguish between potato and cow It's not arrogance it's a rational argument for equal consideration of interests

91,1 There is no dynamic lighting All dynamic shadows in the game are made via the HL2 method where they only appear directly under the object casting the shadow They aren't able to utilize helpful effects like parallax mapping soft particles real time ambient occlusion global illumination and real time reflections except for the water 2 texture resolution was unbelievably low as well as object polycount Imagine those beautiful hand painted textures at full res instead of all pixelated when you get closer than 5 feet 3 Level size and occlusion In Unreal 3 you have to design levels in chunks I'd wager that in the Void engine Dishonored 2's engine the Distillery District Slackjaw's Distillery The Office of the High Overseer and The Golden Cat levels could all be stitched together with no loading times I mean even SOMA's HPL Engine 3 allows for level streaming The only loading screen is when you start the game What they managed to achieve using Unreal 3 for Dishonored was incredible but it was clearly designed gameplay and visual effects wise around their limitations I'm very excited to see the world of Dishonored rendered with modern technology
93,If you're 1 a woman 2 not in the obese category of body fat percentage and go around asking people if they want to have sex it will not be long before you get a bite As a guy it's a little harder I don't have a ton of difficulty putting in little effort to slay but I'd be lying if I said that I was successful more than 2 5 times If you're a male feminist you'll have some serious issues though I don't want to get into an argument here because it'll probably get me banned for having an opinion

103,Agreed they've given him very poor coverage relative to the crowds he's been pulling The NY Times ran what can only be called a hit piece yesterday No mention of the cluster that was the Nevada caucus just over exaggerations of violence from the Sanders camp The problem being as much as her followers will hate to admit it Clinton needs Sanders supporters in the general The percieved way the media has treated them will be unforgivable You can't unify a party that has treated you this way The country has had years of the Dems and Republicans tearing us apart that wedge driven by certain media groups Now we have each party showing serious cracks in their foundation It's interesting to watch but man is it concerning
105,This is r syriancivilwar I am told and not r Assadfanclub like you might think although to be fair that would be a more accurate name for this sub These are the type of comments proliferating here and even if they are reported they are not removed Then people somehow still wonder why so many pro rebel users stopped posting here considering they face this type of uncivil hostility 24 7 here

114,Corellation and causation are different Women are educated in America but they weren't educated first Same with European countries
115,Title III Civil Rights Act 1964 specifically prevents the state denying access to facilities based on among other things religion A judge not upholding this is very much something to complain about Not if there are other judges willing to marry them I remember a similar case where a judge refused to marry an interracial couple this was allowed because they could get married by another judge
123,His gf was solely with him for a place to stay and was fucking multiple men behind his back while he was working 18 hour days
128,Book theories or predictions should not use show happenings as evidence in support or against that theory Look I'm all in favor of the co existence and necessity of both subs more and more as the years pass and the show surprasses the books so I'm sorry if I sound harsh but I've been bothered by this for some time That rule right there is what turns me off and I'm sure I'm not the only one There's a place and context for everything and show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory on your sub I agree on that But with all due respect burying the head in the sand and ignoring everything that ever happened on the show is just pointless denial to say the least As I've said show happenings shouldn't be the basis of any theory there but they sure as well should be allowed to in some sort of way strenght them even in minimally Used as some sort of evidence or final argument For example and in all honestly when discussing and theorizing anything about Melisandre there's no point in ignoring Spoilers S6E1 s the reveal in S6E1 that Melissandre is a glamoured old woman How about Hodor's name origin something that was confirmed by Martin despite being show happening Do you ignore Pretend it never happened Spoilers S5E9 s Shireen's burning which D D confirmed is something that will happen to some sort in the book What about f Aegon Are we supposed to talk about him like he's the real deal and a big game changer in the following books ignoring the fact that since he was cut from the show obviously his part is not that important Jeyne's possible pregnancy Spoilers Season 6 s Robert's Strong and the Gravedigger identities Are we supposed to ignore all that And let's not even mention R L J In that sub are we still supposed to consider that as a 99 certain theory Theories about Ashara Dayne's being Jon's mother are still accepted I mean for a proper discussion and theory every piece of avaliable information should be used Try to minimize the show references sure go ahead but outright remove them is as I've said burying the head in the sand Reminds me of when this sub decided to outright ban any discussion on the leaked episodes in season 5 Everybody saw them everybody knew what happened and yet people were discussing S5E1 in the daily thread like everything was normal and episode 2 might even bring us Lady Stoneheart
131,There are people who object to quotas because they believe it fosters more inequality and doesn't fix the real underlying problems And then there people like you who object to quotas because they're actually just shitlords
135,contact the authorities Because that ever worked Oh wait last time someone did a party got elected and it took them 4 years to do anything and to a scapegoat of all things You know robocalls and Pierre Poutine You can get away with anything in politics Both the liberals and conservatives hire shills to correct the record and it's very funny to see them argue with each other on neutral forums ie not here

160,Except it's not win based Getting matched with a team on 8 wins while my team is on 3 is ridiculous With the player base so small they need to change the formula
163,I didnt say it didnt I'm not saying you should or even have to but your colloquiallisim makes you sound like a inbred sister fucking back water country fuck
165,But it is That's one black artist I didn't say no black people win I said they aren't fairly represented to say that because one black artist swept a majority black genre one year they are is false It's just using it as an excuse to refute every other year and other categories that the Grammy's didn't represent them fairly
167,Depends unused RAM is wasted RAM that you're still powering so if you have a lot of extra then a browser might as well use it to be faster but if it's wasteful or you're pressed for free memory you'd want a more lightweight browser

198,I invite you to go onto the bastions of liberals on Reddit be r hillaryclinton r enoughsandersspam or r enoughtrumpspam The liberals are openly hostile to socialists and argue against them like they're right wingers Liberals are not our comrades and do not remotely have the same goals as us Liberals economic policies fuel right wing populism
199,Lol you statist schmucks love to bend over backwards to justify theft What happens to people who don't charge VAT on the good they sell Enlighten me
202,Yes I agree I haven't come across to many other Atheists that are opened minded Good to know ya
204,Every violent revolution in the history of China has been at a scale that most people can't even imagine and the next one will be very bad Maybe it'll happen soon but I highly doubt it things are going relatively very well for most people Most people calling for blind revolt are ignorant about possible consequences just want to watch China burn
205,After reading this AMA I decided to look the incident up For sure this man had one if not several mental illnesses including NPD Here's http bletstalkaboutit runboard com t34 the link it does go into detail about OP's fathers history So many red flags to highlight Monetary obsession controlling abusive there's one that really stood out though he was a hunter and would make his fianc e an animal lover skin the carcasses

239,So a war with Russia with their nuke subs wouldn't result in the coasts of the USA being turned into glass by a vast swarm of short range thermonuclear weapons Are you seriously suggesting that the US Navy can prevent short range nuclear weapons from doing that Are you that retarded I mean I knew Democrats were thick but that's just next level What do you think Obama enlisted Gandalf to fucking fight

279,One of the ways I've seen the 457 visa holders abused was through poor working conditions The employer constantly holds the visa over their head Complain or cause problems for your employer your visa is cancelled and you're out of the country Salary was an issue in IT but you're right it wouldn't be much of an issue for most Cooks
286,That's just a means to an end I think a lot of folks are really starting to wonder whether or not the GOP is filled with Russian traitors Seeing as their base doesn't really need a single iota of supporting evidence for any of the ridiculous claims they throw out and that there is plenty of compelling evidence for this idea they're constantly trying to run the country into the ground and do share a good lot of social values with the Russian leadership I don't see any reason why we shouldn't continue to discuss the possibility

310,You can choose where you work though and if your job is causing you to be so upset it's time to find a new one Stress is a perfectly valid reason to quit a job No one is telling her not to work Maybe just not work there I know there are certain jobs I can't do because the stress would be too much and that's ok It's ok to admit you can't be in certain lines of work Because so many people work in retail because they just love it despite having many other prospects at the time It's unusual to see someone so blithe about oh she should just find another job as though this is something who had a choice of fifty jobs and decided to work in retail

336,But burning American flags and waving Mexican flags is Trump loves America https youtu be OCabT O0YSM There's no disputing that He sees that the country has flaws The borders are unprotected putting people at risk The political process is thoroughly corrupt Foreign leaders own American politicians Trump cannot be bought Hillary is the epitome of corruption The DNC and it's supporters pretend there's nothing wrong with America because they like the broken system the way it is People like you are useful idiots to them
338,Could you explain to me how Hillary saying worse things makes what Trump said not as bad By your reasoning I could mention some people who have said a lot better things which would in turn make what Trump said worse
340,Then you should have quoted the IIRC line said He did Here's the source and given the source Quoting the he never said that line makes it look like you're correcting him

342,A lot of parenting can be summed up with 'deal with it now little or deal with it later bigger' I inspect dishes after my son's turn with his chore because most of them need to be rewashed It would be much easier for me now to just do them myself but later I kind of want an responsible autonomous man for a son So I deal with the hassle now and don't get a lazy bum later in life It seems like there were a few things they didn't nip in the bud and now it's coming back in a much bigger way So I suppose at least in my eyes if you're going to breed follow through with it and teach your spawn accountability and respect You can start that at 1 year of age Much harder to do at 17 obviously
343,I can get 12 13H SOT when I'm trying this is the part that intrigues me to much with this phone I am eager to try to optimize battery life and if I can get through the day with that much screen on time I'm very active on my phone since I do this for a living then I just might switch to it
347,That's not what I said or implied I'm asking you can someone be considered personally pro LGBT if they are personally against allowing gays to marry I think that answer is no And in that sense Trump is not personally pro LGBT

360,Which is why I'm very curious to see this tighrope of an election they are walking On one hand they hate Trump but he is still the party's nominee I'm sure there are plenty of conservatives who wouldn't mind seeing 4 years of Hillary while getting an opportunity to groom some actual conservatives to take her down in 2020 due to her unprecedented unpopularity That's what I'm hoping for at least
361,It used to be an active part of the game for me And now it's not Enjoy your 20 coins for an hour's work you'll be on our side eventually Promise
368,How did your brain damage come about Just to clarify I'm not asking because of the Mexican thing Same question goes to any Trump supporter There is no excuse for anyone to support him It is not in anyone's rational self interest You have to be either incredibly stupid or an incredibly awful human being or both in a word deplorable

616,Why does English apply the words in this fashion Mostly because England got invaded A lot Mostly by the French or ethnic groups that would become the French later like the Normans That put a lot of pressure to absorb words from those languages For example that's where the different words for animals meats comes from in English The ruling Normans commanded the peasant Angles to bring them beef and pork and poultry while the peasants tended their farms that had cows and pigs and chickens English is particularly good at absorbing words though because of its fairly unique grammar A huge amount of information in English is encoded into word order rather than suffixes We don't use case endings anymore and our tenses use pretty simple endings or even just modals like will go So when for instance Russian is exposed to a new word it has to figure out what gender it is put the appropriate ending to make it that gender if it didn't already have it then figure out how to conjugate it if it's a verb or how to modify it for each case it has to be put in etc Then your listener has to backwards engineer that word from the very little context to figure out how you think it works or how they think it should work Meanwhile English just goes shit is this word a verb Well the order is almost always subject verb object so yeah shove that word right there in that verb slot and let's get rolling If I give you complete nonsense like The ollocks glaffed bartly you automatically know that ollock is a noun and it's been made plural glaff is a verb and you can conjugate the whole thing I glaff you glaff he glaffs I will glaff etc and that bartly is an adverb You don't have to know what any of those mean it already makes at least a small amount of sense Other languages can't do that or at least not nearly as well So when English is given a new word for instance some French guy says rendezvous we can just go Hey that has something to do with two people meeting right Actually it means specifically I meet with you Cool I want that to be a noun now meaning something like a meeting I have a rendezvous at three this afternoon Done Now I want it to be a verb again I will rendezvous with you later Done

672,You can ask him The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses the Bible a collection of honourable but still primitive legends For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions Or how about It was of course a lie what you read about my religious convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it Those were written in 1954 the year before his death He wasn't religious he wasn't Christian he wasn't devout he thought the idea of god was for children and was VERY vocal about his distaste for religion You've been wrong in literally every shitty post you've tried to make about someone who believes in a god somehow being better or more moral than someone who doesn't and you can't even make that argument without verifiable lies and moving the goalposts Just stop
673,What the fuck does that have to do with anything That's nothing to do with what I'm saying
674,Hmm Thanks for clearing that up I always thought bacteria cells die as soon as alcohol enters them regardless of concentration
677,No objection but Bilal won't clear until next week no If you're set on dumping CMike grab the backup before Sunday and use that to drop later I like Rivers Cousins Mariota
687,Funny You'd think someone who hit the reply button to a comment would know who they are replying to There was enough to discuss if you could read and comprehend I don't understand why you keep showing everyone how stupid you are Is it some sort of fascination or do you get kicks out of showing everyone how pathetic you are
688,Why do all of these internet shills pull this stunt The guy makes ridiculous promises and falls short of meeting them He's a scammer I'm sure engineers at the auto companies already know this
689,Fuck Trump That fucker brings it on himself With his thin as hell orange skin Grow a spin mother fucker ALL in the public eye have and always will be scrutinized He just acts like a little bitch about what has happened throughout history He is an embarrassment
690,Lol reinstating Glass Steagall is far from lip service If you think it was a pointless piece of legislation regardless of whether you believe it is good or bad then I can't help your utter ignorance and failure to even perform a simple search of what Glass Steagall is was
696,Its so funny to see My Dear Government playing catch up with my observations After certain point it will become a tragic farce
697,I think there's also just a general dislike of outsiders and change that's pretty universal I like Breaking Bad and I like Battlestar Galactica but if I'm binging Breaking Bad and you switch to Battlestar in going to get ticked off I got invested in that plot I liked it I was comfortable with it and here you come in screwing up my weekend Fuck you If you want to watch Battlestar do it at your own home I'm not saying some people weren't upset about moving down the social hierarchy but that seems to be missing a big party of the picture especially when you consider how many people really weren't effected in that way and had nothing to be worried about Did we see this kind of backlash against lower class whites moving up in the world like with the GI Bill
699,OK I'll agree for a very limited class of people in a very specific country Nexium is cheap because other people are buying it for you and giving it to you For everyone else however it is a very expensive drug compared to others in its class with similar efficacy If that's what you actually meant I'm not sure how it was a useful addition to the debate The point you denied initially was that it costs a helluva lot more For most people it does End of
700,I absolutely agree I was disappointed to see that there wasn't the standard disclaimer at the bottom of the article disclosing that the two authors are with the Fraser Institute The first thing I did after reading the piece was Google their institutional affiliation I knew it would either be the Fraser Institute or the Canadian Taxpayers Federation both of which have a clear ideological anti l L iberal bent
701,AskHistorians has a zero tolerance policy against plagiarism You have been banned from the subreddit We are not fooled by your thesaurus skills
703,seems pretty straightforward identity politics there were a lot of people who view their america being taken away from them by the other more or less brexit remix
704,Actually if you read his archived Reddit discussion archived by users over at r the donald fyi what he wanted to do is impossible He wanted to change the sender address in archived emails So he wasn't incompetent he just needed to do things pretty much nobody can do
707,They pay taxes It's not a choice I'm not talking about taxes I'm talking about a dividend That's in addition to taxes Beer from cases where 1 bottle can broke and lots of food as bribes from restaurants pubs that don't want to pay the extra taxes for on license alcohol Or so I've heard Free beer ended a long time ago At least on the distribution end You do get free meals though but it's not a bribe It's just a courtesy thing Kegs are heavy And it really depends on your delivery route Not worth 6 an hour of course You make min wage and you're part time Everyone under 35 in my experience seemed to be part time
709,Salty Ig they called gold trans people and niggas are subhuman would we say that anyone that complains about its name is salty
712,It's not just the taxes though There are other wider consequences that are acreal pain in the ass that relate to security and the needs of corporate sponsors Believe me I live in an Olympic city It was cool but it's not all that amazing in the long run
716,Your reading comprehension is fucked I'm just gonna take a wild guess and assume that you looked at the picture and didn't read the article if you had you would know that the guy on the left wasn't the one who made the shot it was the girl on the right
720,It's worth noting that the British were known to run official brothels throughout the war I'm not aware of any being forced into it but still interesting to think about
721,I mean come on these STEMlords haven't taken organic chem They're a few years away from having to take chemistry as a class give 'em a break
723,That's not true Critics usually get a handful of episodes in advance to review the show So far it has received critical praise It's likely legit Also I listen to a weekly podcast about television with Andy Greenwald and Chris Ryan and they have already backed up the rest of the critical consensus by praising it Sounds like the show is a winner
728,http knowyourmeme com memes be strong for mother The TL DR is that there is a Pokemon fusion page and fusing weepinbell with doduo causes that abomination to happen and someone made the resulting comic ThatChrisG linked initially
733,This is the correct answer I'd like to add on it is true under normal circumstances that muscle cells do not replicate BUT they are multinucleated and can create more nuclei so they are still replicating their DNA which leads to ability for chromosomal problems But you're answer was excellent Source M D
735,I'd say it'd be misleading to suggest that Europe had such a clear advantage as you imply over the three major eastern civilisations I mentioned till much later This was partly a product of lack of numbers and losses to disease I concede but much of the early colonial history of the east was a matter of grimly hanging on to a few coastal enclaves there weren't the large territorial conquests seen in the Americas the Dutch and Portuguese could not prevent the Japanese from throwing them out of the country in the 1630s and the tiny Dutch toehold that remained had to trade on Japanese terms Even in less technologically advanced Java the main Dutch base at Batavia was closely besieged by the Susuhunan of Mataran in this same period and almost lost In addition to all that there were also legends of more advanced societies far to the south Again these don't seem to have been feared but they were certainly expected to be more advanced than Europe when discovered To expand on this a little contemporary globes and maps continued to indicate the presence of Terra Australis in the far south Over the years elements of fantasy had crept into descriptions of the South Land and in the sixteenth century faulty interpretation of the works of Marco Polo led to the addition of three non existent provinces to maps of the southern continent The most important of the three was Beach which appeared on many charts with the alluring label provincia aurifera gold bearing land’ sailors often referred to the whole South Land by this name The other imaginary provinces were Maletur scatens aromatibus a region overflowing with spices and Lucach which was said as late as 1601 to have received an embassy from Java The existence of these provinces was an article of faith for most Europeans in 1545 the Spaniards had actually appointed a governor of Beach a certain Pedro Sancho de la Hoz who was one of the conquistadors of Chile Even the more pragmatic Dutch did not entirely disbelieve for their ships had occasionally stumbled unexpectedly across a coast that they believed must be part of Terra Australis this was in fact the west coast of Australia
737,This is an unbelievably naive idea There are parts of the country where that could very literally be murder There are small towns where certain individuals would be denied food water housing and transportation and left to starve in the street Further more the businesses denying service would make money off of discriminating like that racist pizza place in New York that refused to serve a gay couple and made a million dollars overnight Also every single time there's a story about a business getting in trouble for denying service I see you posting this same shit and every single time people point out the flaws in your asinine perspective Can you not learn Allergic to new ideas maybe Or are you one of those people who can only write but can't read Seriously what the hell
738,I agree with that and did not mean to infer they were being a dick because they were asking for it Merely denying permission or requesting compensation isn't being a jerk I do think we're talking about two different types of people Professionals who want to be compensated know not to be spreading their work around for free in public where it can be picked up and shared by anyone Unfortunately I have seen and several my friends who are television producers around the country run across very demanding amateurs who don't understand what they've done or anything about fair use laws and just flat out act like jerks EDIT I see where the miscommunication was I should have used a semicolon responding or you're a complete dick demanding licensing and money etc Apologies for my pisspoor grammar there
739,Really You would rather be with an abusive biological father over people who genuinely care about you Being a father is much more than just genes Any guy can shoot some sperm but not all can be a good father
743,Some of the Nexus 5x had an update that made them go into a constant boot loop eventually making it a paperweight
744,I was a nerdy kid My earliest memories were of me watching documentaries about astronomy and the NASA space program I got into genetics because of Jurassic Park I was in third grade when I saw it in theaters and that's when I first started getting seriously interested in biology A few months later I saw my first episode of Star Trek The Next Generation The rest is history
746,You might want to direct that at the person you thought you were replying to genius
747,Well I sincerely hope you're right but my bull shit meter is through the roof Here's why You had a fight she decided to go spend some alone time at the house of the guy you were worried about He kissed her and she didn't do anything to stop it It takes two to tango She kissed him back She didn't tell you for several days She didn't even attempt to provide any validating details people who lie tend to keep things vague less to remember And the fact that you just accepted it meant she didn't have to provide any proof She didn't report it and made no mention of reporting it
749,Shit you scared now Typical trump traitor wanting a free lunch and killing all the black peoples I guess that's just how you was raised
750,Speculate There was no I think or I believe or I speculate that You literally said If they lock us out in an attempt to contain us and maintain the 'integrity' of the website we will unceremoniously spill into every subreddit That is not speculation That is a statement that users of r the donald will brigade other subs in retaliation Nothing ambiguous about it Stop trying to play the victim card
756,Pliny the Younger tells us in a letter Ep 6 25 3 4 that he gave a centurion named Metilius Crispus 40 000 sesterces for the purchase of equipment Could you please explain how much money this represented If this was considered fancy how much would a basic kit have cost
757,First year econ should generally be kept to class and not brought on reddit generalized publicly ultility x function graphs are primarily educational since the real world application of such is nigh impossible to graph when you factor in personal familial social and other considered forms of wealth such as philanthropic as Nick demonstrates in the OP by valuing his donation to the children's hospital
758,That's really my main point This game is in shambles and what are they doing to fix it Nothing or at least that's what it looks like They're too busy coding to tweet yet they can send out cease and desists left and right It seems like they don't give a shit about making a good game as long as nothing threatens the micro transaction shop I agree that botting was a problem but going for these Pok Vision apps is a waste of time that could be spent making the game worth playing If they fixed it the problem would take care of itself But that's the hard path apparently
762,Eh I think all morals are either influenced by the culture surrounding you observe cultural relativism which is then reflected in the laws on the books Either way you slice it your moral compass or lack thereof if you choose to solely follow the law of the land is rooted in a past culture who observed God or a present one whose laws are based on it
765,And none of them are presidential candidates The mods have given their word that this subreddit will not be used to campaign for any presidential candidate other than Bernie Sanders This subreddit is called SandersForPresident There is already a subreddit for Hillary's campaign this ain't it
766,That's the weird part Like okay if your fetish is big butts and it's impossible to deny it at least they EXIST in real life and you can find someone with one to be a partner When it comes to this or those hyper obsesses bronies who straight up fall in love with cartoon ponies or whatever that particular thing doesn't exist It's so weird to me
768,Sadly we all know that it will be unified under the South I don't think that is a given
772,Man what are clowns like you going to do when Obama is gone Still going to blame him for everything in 4 years Pathetic
775,You're right his relatives are old ish approaching 60 so they might've received a scam message I received no details on that But I really doubt it is a scam since we already confirmed Bob got caught by officers in the U S and that he's in detainment
776,1 hour of work does not an employed person make This honestly doesn't make much difference and Roy Morgan count someone working 1 hour a week as employed too The number of people working 1 hour in a given period isn't that big and it also includes a lot of people who usually work more Checking the most recent figures about 700k reported working 1 9 hours in whatever week we're talking about which is about the same as the number of people who have a job but worked zero hours due to leave or whatever Critically all these people reporting that they have jobs but worked 0 hours or 1 9 hours would show up as employed in Roy Morgan's survey too since they you know have jobs The biggest differences between Roy Morgan and the international standard definition of unemployment used by ABS are twofold The first is the definition of what looking for work means It is tighter in the UN International Labour Organisation definition which is used by the ABS like any equivalent national body and has nothing to do with what the government wants since the ABS is an independent agency Specifically you have to be actively looking for work and ready to start work immediately in order to be counted as unemployed within the labour force Roy Morgan also uses the looking for work definition but there's is a much simpler self reported question and therefore they don't factor in whether someone is available to work or not For example someone who is at school or uni and in practical terms couldn't start work but said they were looking would be counted as unemployed The difference between asking do you want a job and actually asking about job seeking activities and availability is the main source of difference in levels The second reason for variation is the ABS makes seasonal and trend adjustments so that the movement in u e rate from period to period is reflecting actual change in the strength of the economy Seasonal adjustment accounts for the fact that less people work in certain months for example the Christmas boom and agricultural harvest season You can see the regular jaggedness in this graph http 2 bp blogspot com XmbV2lJXNHA UDgcpNF7DHI AAAAAAAACYg BfZopElTbfI s1600 DEEWR payments Original Count Unemployed line from1950 png where unemployment declines around November and goes back up around February If we're being cynical not accounting for seasonality gives Roy Morgan reliable headlines every few months as their estimates diverge more sharply from the ABS The reason for the focus on immediate availability and accounting for seasonality is there's a strong policy interest particularly for the Reserve Bank in setting monetary policy in knowing very specifically what working capacity in the economy is like and a great measure of that is how many people are immediately available to work at a given moment The RBA want to know if a movement in the unemployment rate is due to mere seasonality or due to the economy speeding up or slowing down In either case to get the full picture of people's labour activities including underemployment you need other data things like who would like more hours the hours worked per worker who is studying who is injured or disabled structural vs frictional reasons for unemployment etc Unemployment rate alone was never intended to be a measure of social wellbeing there's plenty of circumstances where an increase in the unemployment rate is strictly a good thing eg if it's caused by more people seeking work that can reflect an uptick in confidence
780,Leg pain at night Maybe it's sciatica I've dealt with it Sciatica is a symptom not a diagnosis It could be the result of tight glutes or compressed discs or god forbid herniated discs in the spine If it only bothers you at night I'm inclined to think it's the former in which case you can fix it with some yoga pigeon stretches and maybe pick up a foam roller to massage the flutes and hip flexors look it up on youtube it's too hard to describe here If it's the latter that's trickier Sometimes it can be fixed with physical therapy but sometimes it needs surgery
782,Yeah it's possible these might happen in the show but probably not in the book GRRM doesn't seem like the biggest fan of bringing characters back from the dead since he criticized Tolkien for bringing back Gandalf even though Jon Snow is back from the dead So we'll see
786,your point is absolutely correct people were killed while traveling That's even true today some people are killed by pirates for example Some people are killed by hitch hiking in the USA even this year probably I myself personally would never walk across the USA because I fear getting killed by a random person My car broke down in a rural area at night 60 miles from my home and I was scared But 100 of people that ever lived over thousands of years don't think the way I do a few of them are different and do some crazy shit Some of them cross an ocean and get murdered Others find a spouse among the savages Pocahontas
791,Always gives me chills Hearing him read it in the audiobook while on a night walk is beautiful
792,To be fair if a coworker of mine still believed in the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus I'd make fun of them Same thing here
793,Your opening statement was no one can blame genetics until and the body of your reply included discussion which seemed to skirt the issue by suggesting that the SAT doesn't necessarily require intelligence However everything you suggest would have a relatively strong genetic link If not because the child is more likely to embark upon learning on his or her own then because the parents themselves view education as its own prize something with it's own merit worth pursuing at home
794,I think the difference is that many users are trying to make is that it is not just white but White Anglo Saxon Protestant To carry on your example where does Agnieszka or Ksawery fall in the mix My grandparents could have named their children Dieter Rudinger Mateseuz Adalbert Hedwig or Hanschen all perfectly legitimate white names but of non anglo origin But they elected to go with anglo names because there was wide spread discrimination at that time against foreign sounding names I believe that rightly or wrongly this continues to this day i e it is not skin color but conformity to acceptable WASP culture While being white does provide privilege the actual privilege comes from being able to pass as WASP People that won't or can't don't benefit from that privilege
797,Proxy might be a bit much but they've certainly taken a much softer line on US imperialism over the last 20 years A convergence of interests is not unthinkable
800,He said more though not bigger And the guy was obviously talking about quantity I think the sub might think the dude's overreacting
802,Okay I don't know man It sounds to me that you're rational thinking and you're making a logical decision With that in mind have you considered anything else in the past even if it's pie in the sky or whatever it's called Also what are you studying It sounds pretty brutal Like seriously crippling brutal
803,It is impossible to criticize Feminism validly through invalid means That doesn't mean it is impossible to criticize it validly and in other threads I gave examples of valid criticism In another post you said falsifiying the idea of communism would demand an infinite amount of experiments using every single variable involved to generate absolute proof communism doesn't work This is distinct from the practice of criticizing communism You can criticize communist theory for having a specialized form of history or of attaching character to large economic forces or whatever However we can not say for sure if communism works in the real world as an absolute function of its beliefs If one would like to make the criticism that communism always leads to dictatorships one would have to run such an experiment This is possible but without any connection to the empirical world this is pretty much fruitless I agree with what you said above but I reject this characterization It doesn't make the act fruitless it just only bears real fruit Nobody is the one true feminist Nobody has the one understanding what the ideology is I bet every definition in feminism is work in progress How should one criticize this even unless in the context of ongoing research Since you recognize that humans are imperfect actors but you're still viewing this as a system of criticizing the adherents as criticizing the ideology What you can do is argue with individual conceptions of feminism If every feminist represents an imperfect part of the ideology to argue that feminist's positions is to argue with components of the ideology itself Well why would anyone assume we had perfect gender roles that only do good An avenue that people take in this criticism is to make the case that there is no such thing as gender roles Furthermore you can argue within the concept of toxic masculinity in terms of the origin of these roles patriarchy the necessity of these roles and so on Now I really don't see how to change your view under your own premises My view isn't I'm a feminist change my view it's about the nature of criticism I included a paragraph in my OP with three paths to changing it
808,Oops You're right In that case I may have been skipping things from Singapore and Malaysia at the supermarket because of simplified characters on the packaging Best to check the origins label
