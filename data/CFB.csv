127,127,Even then you still have to finish the last play. Have you learned nothing.,CFB,False,"-0:01, until then anything is possible"
236,236,"His family is rich, the NFL pay day isn't as big of a deal",CFB,False,"hmmm...finish your degree at stanford, potentially get hurt, never get drafted, take entry level job in the bay for $100k....or get drafted junior year, make a few million guaranteed, and if you fail then go back finish your degree and get an entry level job for $100k....


I think I'd leave too"
363,363,Well that's a lot of dashes so I'm gonna say you really care? ,CFB,False,___________ &lt;- All of the fucks I give about Bob Griese
818,818,Just like Marcus Smart shoving that fan,CFB,True,That's always the excuse 
892,892,I wish i lived in an inbred state like Bamer,CFB,True,"Good one? Wish I went somewhere cosmopolitan like Clemson, South Carolina!"
1436,1436,This isn't inaccurate. Penn State also had bi week,CFB,False,I like to think that OSU's offense was just exhausted as fuck after playing our defense and needed some time to recover.
1614,1614,"It's not ""Big 10 hate"". The bottom half of the Big 10 is significantly weaker than the other P5's. Inb4 you respond with an arbitrary cut off to show that the top 4.739 teams in the B1G are just as good as the top 4.748 teams of every other conference ",CFB,False,"Taking a look, OOC might have some bearing but I think it's mainly B1G hate. Nebraska for example, plays Oregon, Fresno St, Wyoming, and then 9 B1G teams with 5 of them (including OSU, Wiscy, and Iowa) being on the road. How is that the 6th easiest schedule of all P5 teams?"
1676,1676,Get chills watching that video. Michigan's radio call makes it. ,CFB,False,"Oh man, that OSU team that tore down the banner... "
1845,1845,"My takeaway is OBVIOUSLY the refs had it in for us from the beginning, and that's the only reason you won.  I mean, c'mon, did you SEE all those no calls for rape (that's a legit penalty, right?)?",CFB,True,"Yeah, I sure saw all that protection during the Pitt game...

Remember that amazing late hit call on Boulware when the whistle was blown as he was falling down? Remember that amazing defensive holding/PI penalty (can't remember which exactly) when the receiver wasn't even touched?

Clear protection."
2242,2242,Give them a few losses and they'll crawl back to r/ockytop,CFB,True,"Jesus fuck just shut the fuck up about it, the more you idiots whine the worse it looks, people are gonna fucking die and your talking about how scared Florida is of a shitty LSU team!?!?! Who fucking cares"
2347,2347,"For the record, I completely agree that that one particular play was one of the worst ref-jobs I've ever seen. 

But I'm not sure if you watched that game, the first 98% of that game was a barrage of the refs jobbing Miami. Miami wasn't the most disciplined team last year, but the refs to that point had called Miami for 18 more penalties than Duke racking up 194 yards. 

In order for this kick-off to occur, Duke needs to score on their last drive. On just that drive alone Miami was called for three pass interferences, two of which there was no visible contact between the Miami player and the Duke player and one of which overturned a clear game winning interception from Artie Burns. Then Duke manages to 'score' with 6 seconds left, except the Duke player was clearly tackled short of the goal-line (which would have ended the game) but it was never reviewed. 

I agree, if I were a fan of a different team I'd be up in arms, but the narrative shouldn't be 'The Refs stole one from Duke' it should be 'The Refs gave a game to Duke, only to take it back in an even dumber way.' It's just very frustrating to see the narrative that has persisted that game, everyone wants to spend hours analyzing that last play and completely forgets the other 59:54.",CFB,False,"Be honest with yourself. If it was Duke that had that play and all those missed called, mixed with a forward pass, and extra players plus one without a helmet on the field, you would be mad. That was Duke's game and they had I stolen from them by the most incompetent refs I have ever seen"
2367,2367,If Clemson wins out there really isn't any reason they'd be out of top 4.,CFB,False,What is Clemson wins out? 
2430,2430,Times flies my friend.,CFB,False,Two years ago. Rip Dak :(
2613,2613,I'm sitting here trying to imagine what could've been said in reply to this that would require such a stern hand from the mods,CFB,True,Swoopes was replaced with a bulldozer for the final drive.

3065,3065,What kind of name is Paul? Or Kevin?,CFB,True,what kind of name is trendavian? black people always come up with the dumbest names it seems
3101,3101,She can get it,CFB,True,Jennifer Garner still got it 
3115,3115,I was refering to the fans throwing crap on the field. They need to accept the position that our program is in.,CFB,True,Yes I am way more mad than a Miami fan who made a whole thread talking about how Miami isn't a national powerhouse anymore(lol they haven't been for 15 years?) 
3145,3145,Beat Ohio.,CFB,False,What is the crowd chanting?
3215,3215,"Lol, bro I was actually criticizing your logic there, no offense was taken once so ever, the center of the universe does not revolve around you. So stop with this, I know you are but what am I bullshit, you Orwellian fuck.",CFB,True,"Lol, bro you being a turd and then get all offended. Come on."
3302,3302,"That was to get you guys back for 1991, when we shared the Championship because the stupid AP poll gave it to you guys, though we won the coaches. REALLY wish we'd have played that year, I had no doubt we would have won at the time.",CFB,False,"They only thing I know about you guys is you beat us in 2000, our only loss that year, and kept us out of that years national championship game at the Orange Bowl!  Bastards!"
3312,3312,"The great liberal policy ""we accept everyone....that agrees with us""

//too political",CFB,True,"Pretty well know that BYU lost any chance they had at Pac-12 membership after the LDS Church threw political support and $$$ behind California's Prop. 8, the anti-gay marriage bill. 

In fact, when Larry Scott first pitched expansion, he proposed BYU come into the league with Colorado. But because of the political fallout in California (as well as Oregon and Washington), BYU was a non starter for member schools like USC, UCLA, Cal, Stanford, Oregon and UDub. It's a shame, too. BYU would have been a nice addition in football and men's basketball. 

Pac-12 went with Utah and CU instead. "
3340,3340,"I can not believe you just said that. Dude, what the hell ",CFB,True,"Ignore? No. 

Take them with a grain of salt due to clear biases? Maybe. 

No one is saying the entire organization/ club was a front for pimping out women to recruits... "
3351,3351,wew lad,CFB,True,Nice no touchdown call fuck you atm
3368,3368,"The last guy I dated went to MSU, but he was a top",CFB,True,Probably not gonna find many out bottoms between BYU and Mississippi State :/
3589,3589,"What is the reference to this?

I did a quick Google search, and came up with nothing recent. There is a link saying he uses gumbo and jambalaya as 'supplements', but that is from 2015. ",CFB,False,And loves him some gumbo.
3665,3665,"All class, you lot.",CFB,True,"jesus christ, this is the QB you guys actually wanted? my god, LSU is gonna fucking annihilate you. you better hope theres a storm near by so you can use it as an excuse to run away and hide again. "
3944,3944,Don't BGEs use charcoal? I get that it's Kamado style but I've never used one or seen one in action. I use my Weber Smokey Mountain with charcoal and I love it.,CFB,False,"Good Lord OP.  Why didn't you just ask Charcoal vs Gas vs Big Green Egg.  
And screw you if you say the Big Green Egg counts with the Charcoal people."
4209,4209,Maybe he would negotiate behind closed doors if UF was willing to negotiate.,CFB,False,"Am I the only one that thinks what the LSU AD is doing is unprofessional?  Negotiate behind closed doors, dude.

And I think what's being lost here is this: LSU has said they offered all sorts of things, but we have no idea if any of them would have actually worked.  They said they offered a plane, cool.  Was it enough for our travel roster and equipment?  They suggested a neutral site.  Did we have a contract with the neutral site stadium?  Playing it Sunday... that doesn't clear up the fact that a lot of officers and other resources that UF contracts to cover the game will be involved in recovery efforts.

SEC also has a lost revenue insurance program.  If it's moved, UF loses revenue (LSU donating a half stadium's worth of tickets doesn't make up for a lost home game, sorry)

This isn't an intramural game.  I don't blame UF for saying no thanks to scrambling for a last minute solution when they aren't obligated to do so.  

It sucks for everyone, but I just don't get the outrage."
4605,4605,Your other comment is referencing prison. Prison and jail are specifically two different things. Mixon absolutely should have been in jail.,CFB,True,Yes. You can reform people without sending them to jail. I left a longer comment elsewhere ITT. 
4873,4873,Yeah it's not just you. They're gonna get chafed circlejerking that hard. ,CFB,False,"Ok, I'm not the only one who thinks the ESPN coverage is a circlejerk right? Like I'm fine with biased local coverage in sports, but this is a national broadcast"
4891,4891,Wait. But actually how are they still top 10.,CFB,False,"OMG I cant believe A&amp;M only dropped 3 spots!

SEC BIAS"
4960,4960,"""I...I mean I didn't think I was gay but now I'm feeling pretty fucking open-minded""",CFB,True,"That's not getting catfished, that's getting lucky."
5036,5036,It got too hyped,CFB,False,My computer spazzed out hahaha
5082,5082,Well I'm happy you got what you wanted. We shouldn't forget why this is happening though.,CFB,False,this is awesome
5293,5293,"I absolutely get it. There always needs to be a Devils advocate though. Group think and confirmation bias lead to illogical and invalid arguments. Unfortunately, different viewpoints also lead to ""you're wrong, because you're a piece of shit""  which defeats the initial purpose. ",CFB,True,"You just don't get it...do you.
"
5422,5422,this cant be right. ,CFB,False,Auburn is 755-0 in games they have won.
5597,5597,Do you even know what it means to be a music major? Honest question here.,CFB,True,"Oh, I'm sure you are fantastic at blowing your little sax.  I am sure all that hard work walking around playing the same thing over and over again is a major talent.  Great work.  You have the talent of a trained seal, umm, I mean, musician.  I am sure you are going to be a massive talent in the much needed field of marching saxophone player.  I have always said if there is one thing this country needs it's more musicians that can walk in formation."
5697,5697,"Pretty sure mens rea is older than hillary, but then again who knows how old she really is.",CFB,True,Only for Hillary Clinton.
5731,5731,"So much homerism, so little knowledge",CFB,True,"McElwain isn't proven. Hoke and Muschamp both won 11 games in a season. 

UF lost a considerable amount of defensive talent, experience, and leadership. That unit carried them last year, and will not be able to this season. They will still be good, but they lost their best player at every position group.  

Their offense should improve, but how much is a question. This is still a unit that could could not score a TD against Vandy and needed OT to beat FAU. Their favorite to win the QB job could not win the same job at Oregon State. Their OL is still patch work, and they do not have a proven playmaker at WR, much less a reliable group. They also lost a senior RB, though I believe they have some talent replacing him at a position that probably requires the least experience. 

As Muschamp's talent leaves the program, the last three recruiting classes have been mediocre at best. And the last three classes are the majority of the starters on any team; while the fourth recruiting class are upper classmen who were not good enough to go pro as Juniors. While there are some stars because UF will always get some players, the depth of talent is just not there right now. 

UF's roster is closer to Miami than it is FSU right now. 

UF's defense was an A+ last season. Their offense was a D. 

This season, their defense will be a B, and their offense will be a C. 

in my opinion. to explain my thought process in simple terms. "
5807,5807,Well McCaffery has had his own slew of injury issues this year. ,CFB,False,"True, but Fournette has been injured most of the season with a chronic ankle problem.  If had been healthy all season I think he would be playing in the Citrus Bowl.  Not that I fault either him or McCaffery for their decisions. "
6273,6273,Typical condescending OSU fan,CFB,True,Just re-read it. I believe in you.
6280,6280,I just don't see him being able to do that against NFL defenses. They'll chew him up like RGIII and Manziel.,CFB,False,"Give him two more years (if he stays), and he'll be incredible. "
6283,6283,That would have put us on the road two out of our first three weeks.  No one in their right mind wants to go to Lubbock any earlier in the year than they have to.  It could be 120 degrees.  ,CFB,False,We wanted to bump the KSU game up because we both have byes that week. So dumb. KSU must've objected because the Trotter said the Big 12 was trying to get the game moved to week 2.
6762,6762,I got banned just because I mentioned the guy with the last name that starts with an 's'.,CFB,True,Never forget the victims
6859,6859,"I'd agree, but I think ya'll are encouraging it too (victim blaming!)

Every Spartan comment has been despondent and predicting a blow out.  Michigan fans were being a lot more humble before last week, but we're taking the cue from you guys.",CFB,False,"I don't think at any point in the last 10 years have MSU fans come close to as cocky as UofM fans before this specific game. Not that there hasn't been cockiness, but outside of alabama fans or maybe OSU fans have I seen cockiness of this level."
