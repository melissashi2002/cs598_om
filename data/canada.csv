384,384,"&gt; ""innocent of what""?

Yeah, see there's the problem. The phrase is 'innocent' full stop, unless you can prove they are guilty of something. 

As to your second question, there's always room for another volunteer, of course, but it's not necessarily making someone's life better overall if when volunteering you also give them handfuls of judgement and demoralize by presuming guilt over innocence. Can you imagine trying to pull yourself out of poverty when everything you do is scrutinized as if you are trying to be malicious in doing it? Because that would damn near kill me. ",canada,False,"&gt;maybe you should stop working with homeless people, because you no longer give them the benefit of the doubt that they are innocent

That could be true.

but my first question would be ""innocent of what""?

My second question would be - who is going to help feed and find housing for them if not the volunteers of a food bank.

I encourage people to take up the challenge and volunteer their time and money to help feed and give shelter to the homeless."

No the island is actually falling apart. They don't even have room in the womens prisons so they are sending them to the mens. Child care is a horror show.

&gt;The difference is jokes are jokes, and arguing that people should be restricted from entering the country are entirely separate matters.
