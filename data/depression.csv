306,306,Join the military. No jokes.,depression,True,"Hey,

If you are open to advice, I would run away and either hobo it a long distance or join the military or something. None of the problems there should be your responsibility. If its literally making you want to kill yourself... No one in your family sounds like they deserve that sacrifice.

That is literally THE shittiest situation to be raised in, god damn. I can't imagine going through that."
462,462,"He said if he doesn't start to get better then he would get help. The last few times I asked to meet up, it would've been to just go to his house or have him come over but I couldn't go to his as he had some problems at home and he didn't want to meet my parents for the first time when he was feeling how he is at the moment. 

It's definitely possible he feels like a burden, he kept asking what I saw in him and why I'd bother with him. I said I still want to talk and we had been. Maybe I'll text him tomorrow evening and see how or if he responds to it.",depression,False,"I would be very wary of someone who doesn't want to get help when they need it.  I was in a relationship with someone who was like that for about a year and when they are feeling bad shit hits the fan because they don't know how to cope with it and have no meds to help them.  They have to want to get help themselves too or else it will never get better and only get worse, if they don't then at best they will rely only on you for help which doesn't work.  

Yeah he's probably not gonna feel like going to see other people he knows because he will have to try to act normal which is draining.  I would only expect him to do things anonymously if you go out like just you two to the mall or a movie or restaurant where there is no pressure because no one else knows you.  

Someone who wanted help and for someone to talk to probably wouldn't stop talking to you and block you unless they just feel like a burden to you which is certainly possible.  Maybe he isn't in a good enough place to be in a relationship right now but doesn't mean you guys can't talk everyday and just wait a little while to be in a relationship if it happens.  Maybe give him a day and then text him again but don't have to baby him on stuff like that, depression is an excuse to be down or sad or whatever but not an excuse to be rude or be a jerk.

It's called freedom of speech whereas you're trying to censor peoples' honest thoughts and feelings.

In psychology, that's called being overresponsible and really, the only person's actions you can control are your own- no one else's. 

I don't even agree that suicide prevention is the best way. I think people should have the right to die in a dignified manner as opposed to be forced to make messy suicide attempts. Everyone has bodily autonomy. A lot of people think abortion is fine but somehow suicide is not ok. It's just double standards and illogical. 

You can't just try to control other people and tell them what to think. I have a mind of my own and I'm not going to automatically agree with what you say just to suit you.

Haven't really visited this sub for about a year, don't consider myself to have depression any more although I still have blips and fully expect it to return at some point of my life.

But this is the most fucking unhelpful post I've seen in a long time. You don't tell someone who's lost their leg that they can do it on their own, so why say it now?

Keep it to yourself. Nobody cares. In fact, more than that. The absolute LAST thing people who are ill with depression want to hear is some arsehole saying that they don't need their support networks. Especially if they desperately need one and don't have one.

So while you're getting over your depression on your own, grow a brain, and think about what you say before you just blurt it out like diarrhea."

4228,4228,"""I'm not depressed, not have I ever been depressed, but here's how I'd handle being depressed.""

What's the play when the only reason you haven't killed yourself is because the idea of what it would do to others is so painful?",depression,True,"I made an account just to address the issue of depression. Depression, ADD, ADHD, and so on, these diagnoses, some of which, mainly depression are referred to as ""diseases"" or illnesses, are all avenues in which healthcare systems make money. Think about it this way, when a parent tells their kid all their life that they'll never amount to anything, even if it isn't true, being told repeatedly, eventually this will become to be believed by the child, and this is known as self fullfilling prophecy. Doctors who diagnose patience with depression are often doing the same thing; by telling their patient that they need to take this medication or this therapy in order to just ""manage"" their depression, these patients are led to believe that this depression is a sentence, something they're going to have to live with, and can never get over. What they should be doing is teaching people how to cope and how to logically break down the things affecting their disposition. I don't believe depression is a disease anymore than I believe someone with type 2 diabetes is stuck with diabetes for life. Fortunately, my mind subconsciously, unbeknownst to me, represses things that stress me out or depress me, thus protecting my psyche. Unfortunately, even though therapy should be a more decisive course to take for handling stress and depression, the fact of the matter is the therapists are really in it for the money. They know how to act like they care, but how can someone who doesn't really truly care about your wellbeing and the wellbeing of your psyche be able to help you overcome the darkness closing in on you? The key to depression is finding someone who can truly connect with you on a real level, and help you see the light so to speak. A therapist's solution to depression is pills and 300$ an hour therapy sessions - but these are essentially paradoxical. Just how when you tell a person that is stressing out that they need to calm down, it is a paradox because in the act of trying to calm one's self down they get more worked up. The problem with most young adults and teens dealing with depression, whether it be from bullies at school or troubles at a job, they don't fully realize that that stuff is temporary. Just how your first job is probably gonna be shitty, if you keep in mind that its only temporary, then your outlook will be that much brighter. My one instance of possible depression was when I was dealing with issues of authority when it came to my parents, until one day I realised, hey, this is temporary, if I play the game now, and do what they want me to, then in the long run, my life will be better as my parents will have no doubts that I am ready to be on my own, and by playing their game, I have their 100% support. Sorry to ramble, I just hate that people are convinced that being depressed means they have a disease. You aren't sick, you are being lied to to perpetuate a system thats sole purpose at the end of the day is monetary gain. Conquering depression starts with you, and starts with becoming in tune with your own consciousness, not on a couch with a therapist or with a happy pill that in the long run alters your brain chemistry, furthering the problem. Your mind and willpower are the key to reaching the summit, the summit being a normal, happy life. I hope I don't offend anyone with this, but I just wanted to share my opinion, not step on any toes. Depression is definitely a real affliction, but not a sentence - this part is the most important, Depression is NOT A SENTENCE! you can live a happy life, one free of darkness. Those bullies that make you think suicidal thoughts, they'll probably end up dead or in jail someday. Those coworkers who make your life hell every day, they'll be gone one day too. Every experience, every interaction, while some may last longer than others, in the end, everything is temporary. You just have to believe in yourself and believe that the chains of depression aren't unbreakable, because they are.

4881,4881,"I volunteered for a sucide prevention helpline for a few years, and these were the basics we got starting out.

1.  Be yourself. Let the person know you care, that he/she is not alone. The right words are often unimportant. If you are concerned, your voice and manner will show it.

2.  Listen. Let the suicidal person unload despair, ventilate anger. No matter how negative the conversation seems, the fact that it exists is a positive sign.

3.  Be sympathetic, non-judgmental, patient, calm, accepting. Your friend or family member is doing the right thing by talking about his/her feelings.

4.  Offer hope. Reassure the person that help is available and that the suicidal feelings are temporary. Let the person know that his or her life is important to you.

5.  Take the person seriously. If the person says things like, “I’m so depressed, I can’t go on,” ask the question: “Are you having thoughts of suicide?” You are not putting ideas in their head, you are showing that you are concerned, that you take them seriously, and that it’s OK for them to share their pain with you.",depression,True,What *should* you say to someone considering suicide?

Overall, my main point was that it makes a huge difference between having put in the effort and finding out it was for nothing, and not putting in the effort and never knowing and always doubting what it could have been like.
