I'm not saying some people weren't upset about moving down the social hierarchy, but that seems to be missing a big party of the picture, especially when you consider how many people really weren't effected in that way and had nothing to be worried about.

Did we see this kind of backlash against lower class whites moving up in the world, like with the GI Bill?",HistoryPorn,True,"When you are white and your country is literally built on a socio-economic racial hierarchy that puts you on the top, there is an economic, social, and political incentive to continue that system of race-based castes. Blacks were viewed as inferior humans, who brought disease, crime, and poverty where they went. To the racist whites of the 1960s, their world was being turned on its head, as generations of dogmatic segregationist ideology was being defeated before their very eyes. Imagine being raised from your youngest memorable age with the ideology that when blacks and whites mix, it is an abomination to God, and will destroy the country you live in, see all the women you love raped, see you be beaten, etc. Literally just boogeyman bullshit to scare them, but hey, when you live in a community of whites who all tell you how scary outsiders are, you arent as likely to seek out outside influences and the bullshit you've been taught is less likely to be revealed for the bullshit that it is."

I'm not a superstitious person, nor do I believe in ghosts, but being in that trench, alone, in the fog, knowing what happened there.... the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I couldn't help but shudder.

1877,1877,"Firstly, hey Cookie funny to see you outside of /r/WEC. 

I just want to chime in and say that our military leaders actually opposed use of the Atomic bombs, most notably General MacArthur and Eisenhower. The problem is with the Operation Z being brought up is that is was an approximation. It was also made before Russia was gearing up to join the Pacific theatre, which would have altered any approximation. The point is, everyone always points to Operation Z as if it was our only option. Japan was already pleading for surrender, however they didn't want Hirohito to be removed and tried as a war criminal. 

Imperial Japan was gone. They had no fuel, no food, and all their ships had been sunk in harbor. Their AA was grotesquely inadequate, as well as having little high altitude interceptors. This lead to the free-reign bombings over the mainland. There was nothing left of what Americans faced in the beginning of the Pacific theater. The point is, Imperial Japan was collapsing and Operation Z was not the only option we had. There was no military justification for the dropping of the Atomic bomb. 

It's not that ""we"" see Japan as being the victims during the war, it's just ""we"" wish we had no gone down the route we did. It's all moot in the end though. ",HistoryPorn,False,"We can't be the morally good guy in every scenario - saying that nuking two cities wasn't the correct moral decision given the scenario. Forgetting the atrocities of what the Axis powers did to other cultures and populations, you can easily make the argument that nuking shouldn't have been done.

But then you also ignore the context of that decision, you ignore the estimate troop loss numbers, you forget that we technically did more damage - with less loss of life - using fire bombing techniques on Jap cities. I mean, war won't EVER make you flawlessly morally correct.

Killing civilians is bad. Bombing two cities that will prevent the loss of millions of others is more of a noble cause to me. Its about the context."

3796,3796,"They had the necessary support, the problem was the cowardice of those leading the actual campaign. For example, Manchester details how for days on end the ships were in a position to push forward to the beachhead which was minimally defended but the omniscient generals decided to sit in the open water instead. When they finally attacked the beach was extremely well defended and the British tactics were horrendous. It was an absolute disaster, but the plan was a stroke of genuine genius cocked up by those in military command. 

Also, if it wasn't for Kitchener's rather untimely death he almost certainly would have been absolved of blame by the Dardanelles Commission. Even so, after the report was released MPs actually began speaking to him again and he was no longer exiled from the meaningful government positions and became both Secretary of State for War as well as Air.

3815,3815,"I'm not only asking why people left. Why did the east German government erect a wall to *prevent* people from leaving, often with lethal force if life was good for most people?

I would guess that many of those who left in the early days were former members of the bourgeois class for whom the idea of a working class standard of living appeared to be a fate worse than death. You can imagine how wealthy Americans might react if they were told that they would live in the projects or trailer parks or other working class housing. Most of them feel entitled to live better than everyone else by virtue of their upbringing.

Another aspect of it was simply that the West won the propaganda war. We have a way of projecting our way of life as being far rosier than it actually is to the outside world. Our media presence either obscures our social problems or romanticizes them. We still see this today. 

Some of this may be speculation. I only know the Germans who stayed."
