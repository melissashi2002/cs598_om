News flash -- the world doesn't cater to your needs. ",2007scape,False,"&gt;Im just amazed at how much of a politically correct safe space all these sites have become.

Yeah because racism and whatnot is great for business and why would a business ever censor that kind of speech when it negatively affect their image in the public eye.

If you don't like sites that have become ""safe spaces"", then join an alternative streaming site like Hitbox where you can act however you want, but mocking others for not wanting to be around when you act like an ass doesn't make them soft or weak just makes them someone who don't want to hear your BS."

Jagex should open it to all members, and LMS should have been polled. It's a stupid idea to poll QoL changes or bug fixes (nmz, splashing, ddef color)  but they looooove adding modes which will die out.

5779,5779,"I'd suggest you quest as much of the attack as you can handle. I'm always a proponent of questing xp because if you decide to change the account later on it'd be a shame if you couldn't because you didn't quest the attack. 

Attack Quests:

Mountain Daughter
Tai Bwo Wannai Trio
Death Plateau
Underground Pass
Vampire Slayer
Tree Gnome Village
Fight Arena
Waterfall Quest
The Grand Tree

After all of that, you'll be at like 46 Attack without ever having to train it, sweet! You'll also get a chunk of strength from Waterfall as well. 

This will also give you most of the bosses for NMZ training, which is one of the best spots for the strength training once you get a bit of it. You need Lost City for the tree spirit boss and then you'll be set (Tree spirit, Vampire, Black Demon, Hellhound, Khazard Warlord, Bear).

You'll be training with a brine sabre most likely, or an ancient staff if you're okay doing Desert Treasure (You should, it's good for rushing too). 

You can just wear a combat brace unless you want to get mith gloves from RFD (They have the same strength bonus, but I think the gloves are a bit better). 

A low-mid level gmaul rusher can be a really simple account to make with little requirements but if you want to ""future-proof"" the account so when you get bored it can still be made into something better/higher level, I'd suggest doing all of what I mentioned. 


For magic training, the cheapest I can think of is using spells like curse, weaken, etc... with full armor on so you splash. It's cheap as hell and pretty good xp until 40s-50s. If you can make it to alch and have patience, there's items that buy in small quantities for break-even on GE. 

For moneymaking, I hear blast furnace is pretty good and has little requirements. You can get easy 20 or something smithing from the knight's sword quest. After that, just make whatever breaks even/small profit in blast furnace until you have the levels to do mith bars. I believe those are profit and addy/rune bars are better once you make it to that. 

You can also tan dragon leather in alkarid, I think that's good money. If you want to train strength while you make money, killing chaos druids in edgeville dungeon is pretty good. It's wilderness technically so pkers could get you so don't take your bank, but the area doesn't see much pk action tbh and it's only like level 3 so just bring a teleport. 

That's all I can think of now. If you have more questions hit me up. ",2007scape,False,"Low level

7557,7557,"As someone who has in fact taken an official IQ test from Mensa, I'd say they are pretty good at indicating intelligence.
