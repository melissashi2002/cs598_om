I am happy that there are no towns upstream from me.",DIY,False,"People get all out of joint about this, but you really think a cruise ship of a few thousand people traveling a couple hundred miles in a day is going to produce anywhere near the volume of poop that the fishes in that same space will?  Everything poops in the ocean.  EVERYTHING.  And many things in the ocean eat that poop.  Think of that the next time you're about to chow down on that lobster.  Bon appetit."
215,215,"What keyboard would you recommend , preferrably with a lower price? ",DIY,True,"Razor no longer uses cherry blues, they produce a switch themselves that comes in green and orange. So to answer your question and keyboard that has actual cherry switches would be better. 




Even if you have an old one made with cherry switches, it still has sub par key caps and overall build quality for the price tag. These things do not come cheap."

488,488,It's common courtesy on r/DIY. Some people have posted up to 50 progress pics before the completed one at the end. Not only is it a pain in the ass to wait for them to load (depending of connection speed) but it also let's you skip the post if not interested in the project.,DIY,True,Doesn't this whole: finished product first thing that everyone seems to want ruin the surprise for anyone else? I never bother checking out the hard work OP puts in if the post already starts at the finish line
552,552,"Because it wasn't a tutorial on how to build something. If you'd posted a step-by-step on how to make a 7-year-old-sized Tardis, that would have been on-topic here.

Why did you do this? What was her inspiration?

Why was she so adamant about this aesthetic that you were willing to try it multiple times, with different glues? Why would you, after the initial failure, waste more money on this idea?

How does this tie into the design of the rest of your home, is it cohesive?

I took an old dresser apart and want to turn it into record storage.

https://imgur.com/gallery/4075H

The shelving isn't attached yet, and that's my concern. The piece running down the middle is 3/4"" thick. What type of screw or nail should I use for the middle piece? If they line up, the screw would go through both brackets and the middle piece of wood. I want there to be a clean finish without screws coming out one side. Should I use a screw and nut? This is my first time in the tool box, so specifics would be great! "
3331,3331,It's been running fine for almost a year without the hoses moving. It started getting noisy before it got really cold.,DIY,False,"I install appliances and you probably have kinked the water supply line. Pull your dishwasher out and make sure everything seems 'untangled'. Also make sure to check your shut off valves. If it started happening when the weather got colder and you have a direct line to your dishwasher, it may have froze. In that case just unfreeze your line then insulate it before it happens again"

",DIY,True,"Copper isn't really strong enough for what you're trying to do here. Yes, I realize your bookshelf is still standing - but I would be wary of accidentally pushing on either end of it, or overloading it.
